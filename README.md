# Noclip Totem of Undying
Very simple cosmetic mod that plays Minecraft's ***Totem of Undying*** animation when dying in any level with NoClip on!
*(There's not much more to it, really.)*

## Features and Settings
In the mod's settings menu, you can customize the mod's features to your liking! Available settings are:

- **Enable Totem Animation**: Enables/Disables the Totem of Undying animation.
- **Enable Totem SFX**: Enables/Disables the Totem of Undying SFX.
- **Totem Cooldown**: Allows for customizing the time in-between each run of the animation. AKA, controls how often the animation plays.
- **Totem Scale**: Allows for customizing the scale of the Totem animation on screen.

***Should*** (Hopefully) work with the Noclip option of any mod menu!

### Disclaimer(s)
- This mod does ***NOT*** aim to replicate/replace the [Totem of Undying](https://github.com/YellowCat98/TotemofUndying-gd) mod made by [Yellowcat98](https://github.com/YellowCat98), neither does it take any code from it. Both mods have entirely different functionalities and purposes, this one's purely cosmetic, while the other mod has fully-fledged mechanics and stats.
- Might not work with the vanilla Ignore Damage option but who REALLY uses that c'mon.
