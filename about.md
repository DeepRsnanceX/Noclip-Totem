# Noclip Totem of Undying
Very simple cosmetic mod that plays Minecraft's <cs>Totem of Undying</c> animation when dying in any level with NoClip on!
*(There's not much more to it, really.)*

## Features and Settings
In the mod's settings menu, you can customize the mod's features to your liking! Available settings are:

- <cl>Enable Totem Animation</c>: Enables/Disables the Totem of Undying animation.
- <cl>Enable Totem SFX</c>: Enables/Disables the Totem of Undying SFX.
- <cl>Totem Cooldown</c>: Allows for customizing the time in-between each run of the animation. AKA, controls how often the animation plays.
- <cl>Totem Scale</c>: Allows for customizing the scale of the Totem animation on screen.

***Should*** (Hopefully) work with the Noclip option of any mod menu!

### Disclaimer(s)
- This mod does <cr>NOT</c> aim to replicate/replace the <cf>Totem of Undying</c> mod made by <cy>Yellowcat98</c>, neither does it take any code from it. Both mods have entirely different functionalities and purposes, this one's purely cosmetic, while the other mod has fully-fledged mechanics and stats.
- Might not work with the vanilla Ignore Damage option but who REALLY uses that c'mon.
